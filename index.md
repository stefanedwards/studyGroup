## We're restarting Rhus

Hi! I'm Stefan and I want to restart the Rhus useR group.

For this to happen, I am looking for collaborators who can help host and lead useR meetings, 
suggest topics, and lead the group.

### Suggested meeting plan

* Late September '19
* Late October '19
* Late November '19
* Mid January '20
* Mid February '20
* Early April '20



### Suggested meeting topics

* Introduction to RStudio, and using projects
* Using RMarkdown for reproducible analyses
* Make your own R package
* Using git (and github) for keeping track of your research (and what to do with large data files)
* Data wrangling in tidyverse: dplyr, tidyr, and the pipe.
* Data visualisation with ggplot2
* Interactive data analysis: Shiny
