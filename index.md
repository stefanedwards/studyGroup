## We're restarting Rhus

Hi! I'm Stefan and I want to restart the Rhus useR group.

For this to happen, I am looking for collaborators who can help host and lead useR meetings, 
suggest topics, and lead the group.

The aim of this group is for bringing together scientists, statisticians, programmers and industry partners
from Aarhus, Denmark and nearby areas, to discuss R-related matters.
We encourage collaboration between local R users and organise training events for those intersted
in learning the language, as well as seminars for discussing and showcasing trends and new uses for R
in data analysis, visualisation and research.

The group is formed after (EdinbR)[http://edinbr.org/] with monthly meetings, were various interested 
would present their tools, workflows, or other interesting uses of R, ranging from beginner's level to
advanced stuff. Presenters could be locals or invited guests, such as [David Robinson with `tidytext`](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2018/02/01/february-meeting-David-Robinson.html).
And meetings were always followed by time to chat.

By framing the study group as a useR group, we may achieve some benefits over a more
assorted interest group.

* The R consortium offers [a support program](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/r-user-group-support-program)
  which offers grants from US $ 150 and paying for meetup.com groups, e.g. [Rhus-useR-group](https://www.meetup.com/Rhus-useR-group).
* "useR" is a recognized brand.
