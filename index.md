## We're restarting Rhus

Hi! I'm Stefan and I want to restart the Rhus useR group.

For this to happen, I am looking people who want to participate and show their work with `R` at monthly meetings.

### What are the Rhus meetings?

The aim of the meetings is for bringing together scientists, statisticians, programmers and industry users
of `R` from Aarhus, Denmark and nearby areas, to discuss and present R-related matters.

The meetings will be of 1-1½ hours duration, with 1-2 participants presenting interesting uses of `R`,
or new trends in `R`. Some examples of contents we are looking for:
* show casing own work in `R`, with focus on how they overcame technical obstacles in `R`,
* innovative ways of data visualisation or presenting data to users,
* getting non-data people to use data,
* summarising new trends in tidyverse or a specific field of theirs,
* or demonstrate a new package (preferable own) with a live-coding session.

### Will there be introductory courses?

I am setting up collaborations with the [Aarhus University Open Coders](https://au-oc.github.io/main/) (group changes is underway),
who will be running data science and R introductory courses (see [Resources]({% link resources.md %}#aarhus-university-open-coders)).
The Rhus useR group will for now focus on users who are past the basic level, and are looking for inspiration for new uses and
potential collaborators. 

### Are there other user groups for `R`?

The idea of this group is formed after (EdinbR)[http://edinbr.org/] with monthly meetings, were various interested 
would present their tools, workflows, or other interesting uses of R, ranging from beginner's level to
advanced stuff. Presenters could be locals or invited guests, such as [David Robinson with `tidytext`](http://edinbr.org/edinbr/2018/02/01/february-meeting-David-Robinson.html).
And meetings were always followed by time to chat.

If you are looking for useR groups in other locations, there is the ([CopenhagenR useR group](https://www.meetup.com/CopenhagenR-useR-Group/) in Denmark,
otherwise look at [jumping rivers' list of R User groups](https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/r-user-groups.html).
