### Get R

**R** is the "engine" we use for data analytics.
It can be run stand-alone and even comes with a rudimentary editor.

### Get RStudio

**RStudio** is a brilliant *editor* for R. Has tools for writing scripts, viewing plots, making packages, 
and supports several programming languages that an R developer might also use.

### The R consortium's R user group support program

By framing the study group as a useR group, we may achieve some benefits over a more
assorted interest group.

* The R consortium offers [a support program](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/r-user-group-support-program)
  which offers grants from US $ 150 and paying for meetup.com groups, e.g. [Rhus-useR-group](https://www.meetup.com/Rhus-useR-group).
* "useR" is a recognized brand.
